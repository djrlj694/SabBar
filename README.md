## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 7.1+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 0.39.0+ is required to build Marklight.

To integrate SabBar into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!
target "YourTargetName" do
    pod 'SabBar'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Marklight into your Xcode project using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "macteo/SabBar"
```

Run `carthage update --platform iOS` to build the framework and drag the built `SabBar.framework` into your Xcode project.

### Manually as a Framework

Add the *SabBar* Xcode project to your own. Then add the `SabBar` framework as desired to the embedded binaries of your app's target.

### Manually as source file

Just drag & drop the *SabBar.swift* source file from the *Sources* folder in your Xcode project.

## Usage

In this repository you can find a sample project with few lines of code in the `ViewController` class for a jumpstart.

*Sample code is written in Swift but Objective-C should be supported too, if you find an incompatibility please open an issue.*
